/**
 * Fail when shipped code changed but the version did not.
 *
 * Claude Code keys its plugin cache on the version string. `plugin marketplace
 * update` fetches, compares versions, sees no change and stops — so a repo can
 * be fully pushed, with every commit on the remote, and still serve stale code
 * forever. There is no error and no warning; the update just reports success.
 *
 * This repo lost three commits to exactly that, and the ROADMAP had already
 * warned about it in writing. A memo cannot fire. This can.
 *
 * Run with --fix to print the bump you need rather than guessing.
